        <h1>Mario564's Tournament History</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website!<br>
        Here, you'll be able to find all the information regarding my tournament history in osu!<br><br>
        <b>"Why would you make an entire website just for this?"</b><br>
        Well as any other osu! tournament player, I wanted to show my tournament history of my own, but most of them put them in a spreadsheet, there's not that much you can do with that, and I thought that making an entire website about it would be a cool idea, I am free to design it however I'd like to. It's also a way that I can practice web developing.</p><br>

        <strong>Most of the images and icons used are edited by me but I do NOT own them.</strong>
