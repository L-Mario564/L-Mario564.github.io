            Alright so first of all you might be asking yourself "Why didn't you just create a  simple Google Spreadsheet doc like everyone else", well the answer is that I wanted to put into use my HTML and CSS skills into something, and decided, why not create a website about something I enjoy doing (in this case: tournament play).<br><br>
            This is also my first website I make public, so don't expect any fancy animations or anything of that sort as I'm a begginer at web developing.
